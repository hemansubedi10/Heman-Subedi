# 👋 Hi, I'm Herman Subedi

🎓 I’m a first-year BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence student at Softwarica College, affiliated with Coventry University.

💡 I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Currently learning Python and web development, while experimenting with digital aesthetics like animated wallpapers, cosmic visuals, and immersive user interfaces.

🛠️ My GitHub is a space where I document my learning journey, share beginner-friendly projects, and build tools that blend code with design. Some of my current projects include:
- **Smart Weather Notifier** – A Python script that fetches live weather data and sends desktop notifications.
- **Animated Cosmic Wallpaper Pack** – Custom video loops
